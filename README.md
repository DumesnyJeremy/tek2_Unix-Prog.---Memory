## Module description
Next installment of the first year's UNIX system programming unit. All projects are to be exclusively done in C/UNIXX (given that it's the next installment of the 1st year's PSU), except when explicitly stated otherwise in the subject:  

- Memory allocation management (brk(2), sbrk(2), malloc project)

In order to validate this unit, you must show, through your project, that you have acquired the following skills: 

- Understanding of the mechanisms of memory management 
  (in particular the links between physical memory and virtual memory); 
- Understanding of the structure of a binary(ELF) file format 

## Skills to acquire
- Technical skills
- Organizational and personal (precision etc.) skills 
- "Group work management"
